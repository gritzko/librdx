#!/bin/sh
#  history.sh — stage/commit a sequence of versions, label each with
#  a tag, then retrieve every version back into the worktree and
#  verify that files that appear/disappear do so correctly.
#
#  Flow:
#    1. `be post -m v1 ?tags/v0.0.1`  — seed: hello.txt + other.txt
#    2. `be delete hello.txt`
#       `be post -m v2 ?tags/v0.0.2`  — drop hello.txt
#    3. edit other.txt
#       `be post -m v3 ?tags/v0.0.3`  — other.txt changed, plus add
#                                        extra.txt
#    4. for each tag, `be get ?tags/v<n>` and check the worktree
#       matches the expected snapshot (files present/absent +
#       content).
