#  workflow.sh — be-frontend dispatch test.
#
#  Mirrors sniff/test/workflow.sh but drives every verb through the
#  `be` dispatcher so we also exercise the keeper/spot/graf pipeline
#  wiring (a sniff-only green doesn't catch a missing keeper push or
#  a stale spot index).  Test semantics match the new ULOG-only model:
#  put/delete only append rows, POST walks baseline + wt and applies
#  the change-set rules, GET prunes stamped files no longer in tree.
