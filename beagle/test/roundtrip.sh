#  roundtrip.sh — full git <-> be round-trip through ssh localhost.
#
#    1. Seed a bare git origin + a working tree with one commit.
#    2. `be get ssh://localhost:<origin>?master` — clone via git-upload-pack.
#    3. `be get <clone>` in a fresh dir — make a worktree off the clone.
#    4. Edit in both the clone and the worktree.
#    5. `be post -m ...` in the worktree (local commit).
#    6. `be post ssh://localhost:<origin>?master` (push the commit).
#    7. Fetch origin into a fresh git clone and diff against our worktree.
#
#  Requires passwordless ssh to localhost (same as POSTtest did).
