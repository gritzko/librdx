#  worktree.sh — worktree clone + commit-from-worktree flow.
#
#  Phase 2 model:
#    * Primary repo holds `<repo>/.dogs/` (store: keeper packs + indexes,
#      graf, spot) and `<repo>/.sniff/` (per-wt state: at.log, staging).
#    * `be get <primary>` in a fresh dir creates the worktree as:
#        <wt>/.dogs  — symlink to <primary>/.dogs/
#        <wt>/.sniff/ — real local dir for this wt's sniff state
#    * Both wts share the entire object store; each keeps its own HEAD
#      via its local `.sniff/at.log`.
