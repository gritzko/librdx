#  mill-merges.sh — 3-way blob-merge treadmill for `graf get`.
#
#  Pick N recent CLEAN 2-parent merges from ~/src/git (selected
#  offline so `git merge-tree --write-tree P1 P2` agrees with the
#  committed merge tree — i.e. the merge was auto-resolved, no
#  manual edits).  For each merge M with parents P1, P2:
#
#    1. keeper fetches P1 and P2 via ssh localhost on ~/src/git,
#       using recent release tags that cover the reachable history.
#       The indexer fan-out populates graf's DAG.
#    2. For every file both sides touched (vs LCA): run
#         graf get <file>?<P1>&<P2>
#       and compare bytes to `git show <M>:<file>`.  Under the
#       CLEAN-merge invariant the git side is exactly the 3-way
#       merge, so the two outputs should agree for files where
#       graf's token-level merge aligns with git's line-level one.
#
#  Merges + expected overlap were picked by inspecting
#  `git log --merges` against master; change MERGES if the repo
#  tip advances past them.
