//  BLOB: resolve (commit, path) or (tree, name) to object bytes via
//  the keeper singleton.  Helpers shared by BLAME and GET — both need
//  to pull a file's bytes at a specific commit using graf's 40-bit
//  hashlets.

//  Descend one tree entry by name.  On entry `*cur` is a tree sha;
//  on OK it is replaced by the child entry's sha.  Returns KEEPNONE
//  if no entry with `name` exists, KEEPFAIL on malformed tree.

//  Resolve (commit_hashlet40, filepath) → blob body into `buf`.
//  Reads the commit object via KEEPGet with the 40-bit-prefix
//  fallback, parses its tree header, then walks `filepath` segment
//  by segment via GRAFTreeStep.  Returns KEEPNONE when the commit
//  is missing, the path is absent, or a hashlet collision tripped a
//  wrong commit type.
