//  AT — sniff's per-worktree state log, persisted at `<wt>/.sniff`
//  as a ULOG (see dog/ULOG.md).  Each row records a worktree-changing
//  op: checkout (`get`), stage (`put` / `delete`), commit (`post`),
//  patch (`patch`).  The row's timestamp is the ms at which the op
//  ran; sniff stamps every file it writes with that timestamp via
//  `futimens`, so file mtime ∈ log-stamp-set means "clean, attributed
//  to the matching row's URI".
//
//  URI schema for rows (new ULOG-only model):
//    repo   `file:///abs/path/.dogs/`      (wt → store anchor; row 0 only)
//    get    `//origin/path?heads/X#<sha>`  (checkout from remote)
//    get    `?heads/X#<sha>`               (local checkout by ref)
//    get    `#<sha>`                       (detached checkout)
//    post   `?heads/X#<sha>`               (local commit on branch)
//    post   `#<sha>`                       (detached commit)
//    patch  `?heads/X#<ours>,<theirs>,...` (N-hash merge URI, graf-readable)
//    put    `<path>`                       (explicit stage of one path)
//    delete `<path>`                       (explicit stage of one removal)
//
//  Row-0 invariant: every non-empty `.sniff` ULOG has a `repo` row
//  at row 0 naming the store (the directory whose `.dogs/` subdir
//  holds the keeper pack-log).  Colocated default: the wt's own
//  `.dogs/`.  Secondary worktrees sharing a primary's store record
//  that primary's URI here.  `repo` is appendable only to an empty
//  log; any other verb is appendable only to a non-empty log.
//
//  Baseline rule: the worktree's current baseline tree URI is the URI
//  of the most recent `get`, `post`, or `patch` row.  Hash count
//  selects the tree backend — one hash → keeper (plain commit tree),
//  two or more → graf (merged tree).  `patch` appends one hash per
//  merge; `post` collapses to a single new commit sha.
//
//  Stamp-set rule: each `get`, `post`, `patch` row stamps every file
//  it touched with the row's timestamp via `futimens`.  A file is
//  "clean" iff its mtime equals one of those stamps.  `put` / `delete`
//  rows are pure intent and do not stamp anything.
