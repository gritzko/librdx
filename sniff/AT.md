# sniff attribution log — `<wt>/.sniff`

The worktree's authoritative per-wt state is the ULOG file at
`<wt>/.sniff`.  It is a single plain append-only text file in
`dog/ULOG.md` format:

    <ron60-ms>\t<verb>\t<uri>\n

and it holds everything the worktree needs to know about itself:
which branch it's on, which commits/patches have touched it, which
files are staged-but-not-committed, and (via row timestamps) which
on-disk files are "clean" vs user-edited.

## Row vocabulary

| Verb | URI shape | Stamps files? |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `repo`   | `file:///abs/path/.dogs/` (row 0 only; worktree → store anchor) | no |
| `get`    | `[//origin/path]?heads/X#<sha>` (or `#<sha>` detached) | yes |
| `post`   | `?heads/X#<sha>` (or `#<sha>` detached)               | yes |
| `patch`  | `?heads/X#<ours>,<theirs>[,…]` (extends prior fragment) | yes |
| `put`    | `<path>`                                              | no  |
| `delete` | `<path>`                                              | no  |
| `mod`    | `<path>`  (watch daemon hint — inotify observed edit) | no  |

The `mod` rows are advisory: the `sniff watch` daemon appends one
per file whose mtime drifts out of the ULOG stamp-set, dedup'd by
in-memory per-path-idx last-emitted-mtime.  POST may use them as a
fast-path for locating the change-set, but still falls back to the
authoritative wt-scan.  Daemon-generated rows race with foreground
writers; do not run `sniff watch` concurrently with commits unless
the ULOG writer path is protected by a `flock` — currently it is
not (see `dog/ULOG.md` §"No concurrent writers").

Row 0 must be `repo`; no other verb may appear at row 0, and `repo`
must not appear elsewhere.  Walk-up discovery (`dog/HOME`) treats a
`.sniff` file in an ancestor as a worktree anchor and records its
dir as `h->wt`; SNIFFOpen reads the `repo` URI to set `h->root`
(the store path where `.dogs/` lives).  For colocated wts the two
are the same directory.

"Stamps files" means sniff calls `utimensat` on every file it wrote
during the op with a `struct timespec` derived from the row's `ts`.
A subsequent `lstat` converted back to ron60 (via `SNIFFAtOfTimespec`)
round-trips to exactly the row's `ts`, and `SNIFFAtKnown` answers YES.

## Branch tracking

Whatever branch the wt is on is encoded in the URI query of the most
recent `get` / `post` / `patch` row (`?heads/main`, `?heads/feat`,
...).  A detached checkout's URI has no query, just `#<sha>`.
`SNIFFAtBaseline` parses the latest such row; callers that need the
branch read `u.query`, and callers that need the tip sha read
`u.fragment`.

## Baseline URI

The most recent `get` / `post` / `patch` row names the current
baseline tree.  The URI's fragment is a comma-separated hash list:

* one hash → keeper has a plain commit tree at that sha.
* two or more → graf reconstructs a merge tree from that hash list.

`post` collapses back to one hash; `patch` always appends one more.

## Stamp-set

`ULOGHas(mtime)` tests membership in `{row.ts : row ∈ log}`.
Every `get` / `post` / `patch` adds exactly one stamp.  A file's
on-disk mtime matches that set iff sniff wrote the file during one
of those ops and nothing has edited it since.

## Retired pointer-pair

An earlier plan replaced `.sniff` with two cooperating
pointer files — `<wt>/.dogs` and `<branch-dir>/WT` — on the theory
that per-branch single-wt and store-side back-pointers were worth
the split.  That plan is not in the code; `.sniff` is the
whole of the per-wt state and is expected to stay that way.  The
`<store>/ALIAS` + per-branch `REFS` infrastructure on the keeper
side is unchanged.
