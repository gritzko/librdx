//  PATCH: 3-way worktree merge driven by graf.
//
//  `be patch ?<target>` resolves the current branch tip (ours),
//  the target ref / sha (theirs), and their LCA (base) via graf,
//  then walks the three trees in tandem and applies per-file
//  actions to the worktree: take-target, leave-ours, or emit the
//  3-way merged bytes produced by `GRAFGet <path>?<ours>&<theirs>`.
//
//  Every byte that ends up on disk comes through graf; sniff owns
//  only the filesystem writes, sniff-registry updates, and
//  classification against the LCA.  No commit is created — a
//  subsequent `sniff post` picks up the merged wt as staged
//  content.
//
//  See VERBS.md §PATCH for the user-facing semantics.

//  Apply a 3-way merge from `target_query` into the current wt.
//
//  `reporoot`       absolute path of the wt root (already resolved
//                   by the caller via HOMEOpen).
//  `target_query`   branch/tag slice (e.g. "heads/feat",
//                   "tags/v1.0"), or a 40-char hex commit sha.
//                   No leading `?`.
//
//  Returns OK on clean merge (exit 0).  Returns PATCHCONFLICT when
//  at least one path ended up with `<<<<<<<`/`>>>>>>>` markers or
//  a modify/delete clash — conflict paths are logged to stderr;
//  callers map this to a non-zero CLI exit.
