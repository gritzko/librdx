#!/bin/sh
#  workflow.sh — sniff standalone get/put/post/delete integration test.
#
#  Drives the `sniff` CLI against a toy worktree with no remote.  Each
#  scenario verifies a ULOG + tree-walk commit cycle in the
#  post-migration model:
#
#    * `sniff put <path>` / `sniff delete <path>` only append rows to
#      `.sniff`; no staging pack, no tree object written yet.
#    * `sniff post -m ...` walks the baseline + wt, applies the
#      change-set rules (explicit put/delete, or implicit mtime-dirty),
#      and emits one keeper pack `commit → trees → blobs`.
#    * `sniff get <sha>` materialises the target tree and prunes
#      anything on disk that was sniff-stamped but isn't in the new
#      tree (files appear and disappear cleanly across checkouts).
#
