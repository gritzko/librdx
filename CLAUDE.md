#   Coding guidelines

0.  Dependencies: libsodium, gtest, google-benchmark, libcurl.
      * Dirs for builds: build build-debug build-fuzz build-release build-asan.
        Recommended cmake conf:
         1. build-fuzz `CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DWITH_ASAN=ON -DWITH_FUZZ=ON -DWITH_INET=OFF -GNinja -B. -S..`
         2. build-debug `CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_ASAN=ON -DWITH_INET=OFF -GNinja -B. -S..`
         3. build-release `CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_INET=OFF -GNinja -B. -S..`
         2. build-trace `CFLAGS="-DABC_TRACE=ON" CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_ASAN=ON -DWITH_INET=ON -GNinja -B. -S..`
        When running with tracing on, always redirect to a file, then tail/head/grep it.
      * clang and llvm are preferred to gcc and gdb.
        ripgrep is preferred over grep.
      * ragel invocation pattern: `ragel -C I3.c.rl -o I3.rl.c -L`, avoid other modes.
    There is a fast CI script at scripts/ci-fast.sh to check for regressions 
    after you edit things. When introducing new behavior, always add
    tests, preferably by adding cases to existing table driven tests.
1.  Please follow the ABC coding style:
      - no pointer arithmetics, use slices where possible,
        u8 pad[64] is not OK, a_pad(u8, pad, 64) is OK (has end pointer).
        see abc/S.md abc/B.md on slices and buffers.
      - prefer typed slice functions over generic macros (e.g. `u8bReset()` over 
        `Breset()` or `u8sMv()` over `$mv()` over direct access s1[0] = s2[0]),
      - use slice iteration where possible, `$for`, `$rof`, `$eat`
      - use slice/buffer macros where applicable: a_head, a_tail, a_rest, a_pad
        Again, avoid any pointer arithmetics.
      - stdlib legacy use is discouraged
      - POSIX calls are normally wrapped (e.g. FILE.h, POL.h)
      - utf8s for text slices, u8s for binary
      - PRO.h can not be imported by public headers as it pollutes the namespace.
        To use PRO.h macros (call, done, etc) a function must start with sane() check.
        Also, the main() has to be MAIN(), TEST() or fuzz() to declare PRO.h globals.
2.  Function naming convention: `MOD typ8 VerbStuff ()`, e.g. `HEXu8sFeed()` 
      - MOD is the module (header)
      - ABC record types have fixed bit layout, their name most often ends
        with the bit width, e.g. `sha256`
      - Verb is the function name per se
      - Stuff may be combinatorial (the Go way), e.g. see `FeedXYZ()` functions
3.  For anything implemented we must ensure it actually works (test, bench, fuzz).
    Each project has `test/`, `fuzz/` and `bench/` subdirs, follow that pattern.
      - tests: preferably Go-style, table driven property tests.
        It helps to fill that table before you start implementing the feature itself.
      - fuzz tests: based on respective property tests. Fuzz fails, once minimized, 
        get fed back into property tests to prevent regressions. Use clang/libfuzzer.
        On long runs, use all cores, put the corpus into appropriate $HOME/Corpus/ dir.
        Run fuzzer with `nice`. Use `must()`, not `assert()`. I repeat:
          * fuzz, find a crash
          * minimize
          * add a repro to the tests
          * fix
          * keep fuzzing
      - benchmarks: test important performance parameters, preferably in a way 
        that makes regressions brutally obvious.
4.  When summarizing texts and reporting the state of things, write 1 paragraph, no more.
5.  Resource allocation (alloc, map, file open) normally happens in the very top
    of the call chain. Anything downstream works with the provided resources. Still,
    any functions that take some resource should be examined for leaks. Pay attention
    to the call()/try()/then try() pattern. Separating resource allocation and use
    into different functions is recommended.
6.  Funny macros from PRO.h should not pollute namespaces, hence that header must not
    be included by any other headers, only .c files.
7.  Error codes are uppercase, follow predictable pattern, numeric values are
    ron60 coded, see abc/ok64 utility
8.  Use different build dirs: build/ for debug, build-release/ for bench, build-fuzz
    for fuzzing and build-load (release build, heavy long running tests),
    all under the project root, e.g. librdx/build, also see WITH_ASAN, WITH_FUZZ,
    WITH_LOAD in the CMakeLists.txt.
9.  Feel free to use the xx utility for small RDX-related calculations (merge etc)
    Use the build-release version to avoid tracing output.
10. No pointer arithmetics. None. Just don't. There are all sorts of typed slice
    handling functions and macros, don't calculate any pointers manually.
11. Avoid cat-ting large files and *never* send traces to stdout. Redirect to a file,
    then grep/tail the file.
12. Read DONT.md and INDEX.md. Reread them after every compaction.
13. Dont fucking reimplement things repeatedly. When planninng, check INDEX.md for 
    a relevant header, the thing may already exist. Always ask if unsure.
